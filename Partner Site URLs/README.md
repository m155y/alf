# Team51 Site URL Alfred Workflow
 
I created this workflow to bypass the eternally long wait for the list of WordPress sites to load. I have created options for all of the Team 51 sites that are hosted on Pressable. Sites that are just connected via Jetpack need to be added as they are encountered. I'll keep this repository updated with the latest version of my workflow.

### Instructions
After starting a Support Session (so you'll have an incognito Chrome browser tab open), highlight the tab's url or open a new tab. Next, fire the Alfred Workflow. By default, the keyword `site` will bring up a filtered list in Alfred. Just add a space and start typing the URL or name of the site. Once you've entered the site name, you'll be prompted to choose either the production site or the Pressable account for the site. This will copy the site URL to your clipboard. If you already have your cursor in the web address field, it should automatically paste.
